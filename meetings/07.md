## Agenda

1. Introductions - recorded in the Attendance
   * Nick Ruest, York University

   * Andy Wagner, University of Toronto
   * Chuck Schoppett, USDA
   * Mark Jordan, SFU
   * Danny Lamb, dgi
   * Robin Dean, Colorado Alliance
   * Andrew Woods, Duraspace
   * Kevin Clarke, UCLA
2. [migration-utils](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils)
    * [Portland Common Data Model](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/Portland+Common+Data+Model) ([repo](https://github.com/duraspace/pcdm))
      * Mike and Danny have been doing alot of work on this recently. A recent ticket took care of legacy systems and FOXML. There is a [new table](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils#property-mappings) with mappings. Some decisions have been made about how to map Fedora 3 properties that don't exist in Fedora4 (details in the table) 
      * Undeclared namespaces will show up as ns001, ns002, etc. [This](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/FCREPO-1553?jql=labels%20%3D%20fedora-3-to-4-migration) allows users to register useful namespace prefixes.
      * Andrew: are we encouraging folks to test these mappings or waiting until more mapping is done?
       * Nick: We are definitely encouraging people to test. If you are using the Islandora 7.x-2.x vagrant machine and install migration utils on it you can configure it to do some testing.
     * Andrew: If you want to run migration utils, there's a [PR going in today](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/pull/19) that will have it packaged as an executable .jar file. 
    * [Hydra Metadata Working Group](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Metadata+Working+Group)
      * Nick built up Islandora Ontology, mapping how things currently stand with Islandora 7.x and Fedora 3. There is one for [RELS-EXT](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_ontology/blob/master/relsext.rdf) and [RELS-INT](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_ontology/blob/master/relsint.rdf). Some are Solution Pack specific (Paged Content, Compound, Image Annotation), some are from XACML. We can use this to start the discussion on how these should carry over to Fedora 4 - leave them as legacy, map them, etc?
        * Robin: Should we record in the comments what SP each of these is used by? Where would be the best place to record why the field exists at all?
          * Nick: All of those things would be good in the RDFS comments
        * Robin: Should we documents things used by single SP's seperately? Image Annotation brings a lot of odd things to the table
          * Conclusion: As long as we're just documenting modules in the release, it's ok. We can ask community members to follow this template for documenting their own unique predicates. [Example from Islandora 7.x-2.x](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora/blob/7.x-2.x/docs/technical-documentation/islandora-namespace-predicates.md) and how it's been done so far.
          * Definitely should start adding comments for where these come from. Will ask on the list for opinions about how this should be included.
          * Next steps: Working with Hydra and greater Fedora community on PCDM. Concentrate on mappings and modelling. Help is welcome! Please contact Nick. And get involved in the [Hydra Metadata Working Groups](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Metadata+Working+Group) (it's just a name. All are welcome). [Islandora Metadata Interest Group](https://github.com/Islandora/Islandora-Metadata-Interest-Group) is not quite related, but may touch on this is asked.
    * [migration modeling](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora/blob/7.x-2.x/docs/technical-documentation/migration.md)
